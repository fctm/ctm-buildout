Help to configure the theme
===========================

A series of recommendations and helpful information is shown so as to
properly configure the theme of the site.

Overview
--------

 * The configuration panel for the site theme is located in *Home*, into
   the *Content* tab, and it is named **ctm-colorsettings**.

 * What you configure is: project logo, header background, general
   color of the site, footer background color, portlets background
   color and the footer.

Logo and background image of the header
---------------------------------------

 * In order to change the logo and the background of the header you
   should edit the configuration panel ctm-colorsettings.

 * It is recommended for the image used in the logo to have a
   transparent background and a width:height ratio similar to or
   greater than 2:1.

 * The minimum size for the logo image is 100px by 100px.

 * Two types of images can be used to configure the background of the
   header: 1- A narrow not too high photo that will be repeated over
   the head (eg: 55x180 px). 2 - An image that fills the width of the
   header and that is not too high (eg 1100:180 px).

Footer
------

 * If you want to modify the content of the footer, you must also edit
   Footer tab in the ctm-colorsettings panel.

 * You can add text, photos and even videos. The content of this page
   will appear in the footer of the site.

 * If you can't see in the footer what has been edited, make sure that
   the ctm-colorsettings panel is **published**.

Footer and Portlets background color
------------------------------------

 * To change the color of the footer portlets you should edit the
   configuration panel ctm-colorsettings.

 * Both are white by default. In case you want to change them, you
   should use the recommended option.
